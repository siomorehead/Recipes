# recipes

# This website consists of an index page linking to three other randomly chosen recipes.

# Doing this project introduced me to the basics of HTML, and helped with getting familiar with when/how to write commits.

# The project wasn't very difficult and mainly took time, however, it was still a valuable learning experience.
